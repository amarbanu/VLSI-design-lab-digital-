# VLSI-design-lab-digital-
I am putting all the work done by me in the lab in this repository.
Experiment 1: Sum of first N natural numbers.
Experiment 2: Designing a sequence generator (1,2,4,8,4,2,.. and repeat), and then implementing it in 2 different ways
                version 1: we use 3 flip flops, assign states and in the end use a decoder logic
                version 2: we use 5 flip flops, and take the outputs directly from the flip flops.
